# North-East-Policy-Making
Decision-making is a challenging responsibility for leaders at all levels, from households to workplaces and entire communities. However, with the vast amount of data available to us daily, this process becomes more efficient, enabling quicker and more effective decisions.
This project explores how data analytics, economic insights, and evidence-based decision-making can shape regional policies and enhance community well-being in the North East of England. By analyzing key factors such as economic trends, skills development, and public service delivery, the project will highlight the power of data storytelling, visualization, and predictive modeling in informing policy decisions.

The study will focus on major cities in the North East, including Newcastle, Sunderland, Durham, Middlesbrough, Gateshead, Darlington, and  Hartlepool.
This project aligns with the North East Combined Authorityâ€™s goal of using data and evidence to inform policy, strategy, and economic growth initiatives ultimately driving positive transformation in the region.

# Problem Statement
Effective policymaking and regional development require accurate, data-driven insights to:
* address economic disparities
* workforce challenges, and
* public service inefficiencies.
  
However, decision-makers in the North East of England often struggle with fragmented data, limited access to real-time economic indicators, and the complexity of translating data into actionable policies.

Without a structured approach to data integration, analysis, and visualization, it becomes difficult to forecast economic trends, assess the impact of public initiatives, and allocate resources effectively.

This project aims to bridge this gap by utilizing data analytics, predictive modeling, and interactive dashboards to provide comprehensive economic insights. By doing so, policymakers will be empowered to make informed decisions that drive sustainable economic growth, enhance workforce development, and improve public services across the region.
