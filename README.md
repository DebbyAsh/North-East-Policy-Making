# North-East-Policy-Making
Decision-making is a challenging responsibility for leaders at all levels, from households to workplaces and entire communities. However, with the vast amount of data available to us daily, this process becomes more efficient, enabling quicker and more effective decisions.
This project explores how data analytics, economic insights, and evidence-based decision-making can shape regional policies and enhance community well-being in the North East of England. By analyzing key factors such as economic trends, skills development, and public service delivery, the project will highlight the power of data storytelling, visualization, and predictive modeling in informing policy decisions.

The study will focus on major cities in the North East, including Newcastle, Sunderland, Durham, Middlesbrough, Gateshead, Darlington, Hartlepool, and South Shields.
This project aligns with the North East Combined Authorityâ€™s goal of using data and evidence to inform policy, strategy, and economic growth initiatives ultimately driving positive transformation in the region.
